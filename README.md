## UX Design

---

- As a user, I would like to have a simple theme for such a game to reduce any unwanted distractions and 
be allowed to focus on the game at hand. 

This has been achieved by using a minimal design and light colors as to not be too 
distracting or invasive. 

- As a user of this game, i would like there to be a contrast between the cards and the background.

To enable a more enjoyable experience, i have added a gradual graient inside of the game board horizontally,
going from light blue to white.

- As a user, I would like there to be some kind of seperate system for before the game begins and after
 it has ended.

When the site is initially loaded, the user will be greeted with the start screen which is a a lot darker than
the rest of the page, this is to now draw the users attention away from the game and now towards the rules of the 
start screen.

- As a user, if I have won or lost the game, I would like there to be some kind of change which notifies me of
 what is happening.

 If the 'Time Remaining' reaches 0, the user will no longer be able to continue as there will be another 
 dark overlay which covers the screen explaining that they have lost the game, a game-over sound will be played
 users are welcome to try again by simply clicking on the screen and the whole page will be refreshed, good as new.
 
 Similarly, if the user wins the game, a victory sound will be played as well as the dark overlay appearing, congratulating
 the user on winning the game, as well as inviting them to play again simply by clicking on the screen.

- As a user, I would like there to be sounds which keep me engaged and that celebrate my victory
   of matching two cards.

When a user clicks on any card, there will be a litle flip sound played. If the user then proceeds to flip another
card and is lucky enough to make a match, there will be a little chime played to let the user know that they have
been successful in making a match. 
 
- As a user, I would like to be able to report any problems which I may find during my experience while playing the 
game.

To enable users to do this, I have added in a feedback form which is locted on a different page. Users can easily gain 
access to this by clicking on the link at the bottom of the page which is clearly directing them to an area to leave feedback.

All sections of the feedback form will have to be filled out in order for the user to send the feedback to me, this prevents
any missing infomation being sent. 

Once the submit button has been clicked and the sending of the email is successful, the user will be notified of this in the form 
of a JavaScript alert box which will pop up and show them the success message, similarly, if there is an error in sending the email,
they will be notified of this in the same way.
